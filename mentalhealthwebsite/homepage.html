                Are you or somebody you know struggling with mental illness? Have you spent hours trying to make sense of lengthy, boring, medical websites and fallen into a spiral of self diagnoses? Or have you spent hours scrolling through instagram and all its glamorized self care solutions it’s trying to sell you? If any of these experiences sounds familiar or if you simply want to expand your knowledge in the world of mental illness and mental health you’ve come to the right place.
            </p>
            <p>

                The reality is that mental illness is an incredibly normal thing that many people will struggle with at some point or another in their lifetime. The argument that our website is making is that mental health should be approached from a perspective that is somewhere in the middle of the spectrum described. On one hand you can’t just cure mental illness with a bubble bath but on the other hand it also doesn’t always need to be treated like a catastrophic life-threatening chronic illness.

                We currently offer information and resources about four major and common mental illnesses. So take a look through our helpful sections to read more and find free resources about the specifics of those disorders. Or if you just need a laugh head on over to our forum/satie section EDIT. Because sometimes laughter really is the best medicine!
